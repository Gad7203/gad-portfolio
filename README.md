👋 Hi, I'm Gad Michael

Welcome to my Portfolio Repository!  
I’m a passionate web developer from Ghana who believes in Discipline > Luck — and I’m always learning, building, and improving my craft every day.

🌍 About This Project
This repo contains the source code for my live portfolio site:  
👉 [gad7203.github.io/gad-portfolio](https://gad7203.github.io/gad-portfolio/)

It’s a simple but expressive project built to showcase:
- My web development skills  
- My journey and personal growth  
- My interests and values  

💻 Tech Stack
- HTML5 – structure  
- CSS3 – styling and animations  
- JavaScript (ES6)– interactivity  

⚽ Beyond Coding
When I’m not coding, I’m probably:
- Practicing football  
- Designing creative concepts  
- Or improving my personal projects  

I believe success comes from consistency, passion, and a never-give-up mindset.
